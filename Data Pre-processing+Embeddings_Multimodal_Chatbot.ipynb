And, they're made with high quality material, so these dinos will never go extinct! The intimidating-looking, and instantly recognizable Stegosaurus was the largest of plate-backed prehistoric herbivores. Scientists have suggested that the Stegosaurus’ iconic plates were for defense against predators, but this is unlikely as the plates were quite thin. Others have said the Stegosaurus’ spiked tail may have been used as a weapon. Terra’s Stegosaurus toy accurately recreates the formidable size and terrifying presence of this iconic predator. In particular, the large, heavily built frame and rounded backs of the mighty Stegosaurus are faithfully depicted in the dinosaur replica.

The intimidating-looking, and instantly recognizable Stegosaurus was the largest of plate-backed prehistoric herbivores. Scientists have suggested that the Stegosaurus iconic plates were for defense against predators, but this is unlikely as the plates were quite thin. Others have said the Stegosaurus spiked tail may have been used as a weapon. Terras Stegosaurus toy accurately recreates the formidable size and terrifying presence of this iconic predator. In particular, the large, heavily built frame and rounded backs of the mighty Stegosaurus are faithfully depicted in the dinosaur replica.
